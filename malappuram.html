    <p>Kozhikode was the capital of Zamorin kings until the British made it part of the Madras province. Formerly called Calicut, the city was a major port on the Maritime Silk Road, frequented by traders from Arabia, Persia and later Europe. The English word calico, a cotton textile, originated from this city's old name.

        Kozhikode used to be a romantic location with the charm of centuries-old streets and the smell of local sweets in the air. Today, Kozhikode is a developed city with high tech malls and modern cafe's, but there still remains the purity of heritage.Many renown philosophers have titled kozhikode as the best place to live in. The city still has its charm left with wonderful people and cultures.
        
        Kozhikode has many important educational institutions including calicut medical college, Indian Institute of Management, National Institute of Technology </p>
