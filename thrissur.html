    <h1>Thrissur</h1>
    <p>Thrissur is one of the oldest cities in Kerala. The legend says, the city was the town created by Lord Parasurama (6th incarnation of Lord Vishnu) soon after formation of Kerala, by creating a large Shiva temple. The entire city is formed around the grand Shiva temple known as Vadakumnathan Temple. The city's original name was Thir-Shiva-Perur (Sacred city of Shiva), which got later shortened as Thrissur. The temple is in the center of a mega roundabout that is of 64 acres. This round is known as Swaraj Round and the giant square in front of the temple is known as Thekkinkad Maidan. All roads of Thrissur connect to this.</p>
